      "title": "Protein Folding at Home",
      "description": "This month, join us and hear from Heath as he leads an interactive walk-through of The Fold for Covid project. The Fold for Covid project aims to make it easy to donate spare compute capacity to support COVID-19 research with a few simple steps.\n\nThis effort contributes to the Rosetta@Home project, led by the Baker Laboratory at the University of Washington, which uses distributed computing to help scientists and doctors find potential treatments for COVID-19.\n\nYour contributions help researchers look for proteins that bind to the famous \"spike\" protein on COVID-19. By finding these binding proteins, doctors hope to develop medicines that prevent the virus from entering healthy cells.\n\n**About the speaker:** Heath has more than 15 years of experience in product development, embedded electronics, research and technical analysis, with specialities in hardware design for manufacturability, artificial intelligence, data communications and signal processing. Heath's experience covers the journey from idea to market entry, including scoping, manufacturing and validation.",

      "description": "Automating and scaling data ingestion for boating - presented by Jack McKew\n\n**The Talk**\nEvery day, billions of people around the world use a map to get information about their surroundings. The data behind these maps also changes very frequently, but how do we keep these interactive maps up to date for the user? This talk goes into how Deckee addresses the problem of frequently updated data behind maps, and how it’s served to users around the globe at scale. Deckee is the free boating app for local information, trip logging, weather, navigation aids and official alerts and notices.\n\n**The Speaker**\nJack is a Senior Full Stack Engineer at Deckee, focused on data science and engineering. Jack has a published paper in The Geography of Covid-19 Spread in Italy Using Social Media and Geospatial Data Analytics and has a degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Newcastle.\n\n**The venue**\nNewcastle Uni's [I2N Hub Honeysuckle](https://www.newcastle.edu.au/engage/business-and-industry/integrated-innovation-network-i2n/incubator/i2n-hub-honeysuckle), you can get there by Tram either Civic or Honeysuckle stops, bus (check the timetable) & at 6pm there should be plenty of parking on street on a Wednesday (though ymmv).\n\n**The vibe**\nCome along for an informal chat around Mark's presentation, feel free to ask questions before, during, & after, and networking at I2N, Newcastle Uni's Integrated Innovation Network.\nAll skills welcome, whether you're simply curious or you've got decades of experience!\nPizza & Soft drinks to be provided, an optional wander to one of Newcastle's local pubs afterwards if anybody wants to continue the conversation!",
