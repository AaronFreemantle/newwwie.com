(Subscription models only!)\n* How gaming algorithms may be the all-conquering USP of soft-body machines.\n* Why he sees explaining our AI decisions as essential to success.\n* His bets on the next few years, considering the scars of the past.\n\n##-------------------------------------------------------------------##\n\n**Ranjit Rees-Sidhu (Sid)** has worked in the industry for over twenty years, running successive data analytics companies in the UK and Australia.
