      "description": "Hello friends! Welcome back to another instalment of NCSG.\n\nThis month, we're lucky to have Geoffrey Campey, one of the long-standing supporters of NCSG (for which we are very grateful). Geoff is a rehabilitated lawyer (13 years clean!) and computer scientist, and his unique intersection of legal and technical skills have manifested themselves into his consultancy, Social Media Evidence Experts (SMEE). Outside of SMEE, Geoff enjoys long walks on the beach, sunsets, red wine, and bacon and egg rolls from the Edwards.\n\nGeoff will be talking about insider threats, which I'm sure will make you feel very safe and comfortable with your colleagues.\n\n**Event details:**\n\nDate: June 30th, 2022\nTime: 18:00-20:00ish (or until we go to the pub)\nVenue: 16 Honeysuckle Drive, Newcastle (The University of Newcastle 'Q Building') - second floor 'seminar space'\nFood: Provided, please inform us of dietary requirements when RSVPing\nDrink: Non-alcoholic provided, come and grab a few with us at the pub after if you'd like!\n\n**The rest:**\n\nIf you’re experiencing any symptoms representative of COVID-19, please don’t attend.
