      "title": "Andrew Goodwin - Interactive Data Visualisations using p5.js",
      "description": "This month, we have **Andrew Goodwin** showing us how he used the p5.js library to make interactive, client-side visualisations of medical data.\n\nAndrew Goodwin is an experienced data engineer with a track record of developing innovative and novel spatial and temporal analysis systems, including the software that formed the foundation for local spatial analytics company Anditi.\n\nAndrew was based in Toronto, Canada from 2011 to 2016. During this time he was engaged to build a bespoke data collection and storage system for the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at a large Children's Hospital. This system has since been used to collect over 1.5 million patient-hours of high frequency physiological signals from over 9000 critically ill children. These datasets are used by numerous researchers from around the world to develop novel machine learning approaches for use in intensive care medicine. The timeseries database technology Andrew developed is now being trialed at several other hospitals in Canada, and more recently at the Children's Hospital at Westmead in NSW.\n\nAndrew is currently nearing completion of a PhD through the University of Sydney where his research focuses on modelling data flow through clinical systems. His research publications are often accompanied by interactive data visualisations that have been developed using P5.js. In this talk Andrew will give a \"behind the scenes\" tour of some of these applications, and will discuss the design tradeoffs he had to consider while building them.\n\nDate: Tuesday 22nd of November\nLocation: Mudbath\nUnit 8 (Upstairs) 710 Hunter Street. Entry via the left side of the building.\nLivestream: https://livestream.mudbath.com.au/\n\nDoors open at 6pm for socialising and pizza. The talk kicks off at 7pm.\n\nOff-street parking is available directly behind the offices, entry is via the ibis hotel driveway.\n\n*Thanks to the Newy Tech People for sponsoring pizza.*",

      "description": "Hello friends! Welcome back to another instalment of NCSG. This month, we've got James Diacono, organiser of NewcastleJS and Software Engineer at CrossCountry.\n\nTalk synopsis:\n*Most of our communication over the Web is secured by HTTPS. But how does HTTPS actually work? James explores the underlying cryptography of HTTPS, as well as its strengths and weaknesses. He briefly describes an experimental alternative to HTTPS, just to show that we have options.*\n\n*James Diacono is an application programmer with an amateur interest in cryptography.*\n\n**Event details:**\n\nDate: Thursday Nov 24th, 2022\nTime: 18:00-20:00\nVenue: 16 Honeysuckle Drive, Newcastle (The University of Newcastle 'Q Building') - second floor 'seminar space'\nFood: Provided, please inform us of dietary requirements when RSVPing\nDrink: Non-alcoholic provided, come and grab a few with us at the pub after if you'd like!\n\n**Getting there/parking/public transport:**\n\n* Event location is [here](https://goo.gl/maps/rCqoDx8MbjqyeHTMA) \\- please use the western door\\.
