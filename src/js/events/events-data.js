      "description": "This month, there's something for everyone with our Trio of Analytics Dips 😋, courtesy of Team Honeysuckle Health:\n\n* **Stats**: Imagine you organised a great big initiative, and it just concluded yesterday. That initiative could be your marketing campaign, staff training course, health intervention, etc.\nYou feel like things went well, but you wish you'd thought about *proving* the success of your initiative with *hard numbers*. But it's all too late, now that the intervention is complete... right?\nFear not! We'll talk about observational studies and look at how they can quantify the success of your intervention, even *after the fact*. ⚖\n* **Machine Learning**: Sometimes you need to compare things that you can't quite measure directly 📏.\nTake, for instance, the cost of the *same* surgery. Though the same procedure was delivered, the price will still depend on the patient's age, where they live, their medical history and risks. How can we tell if a surgery was overpriced... when no two are different? Answer in this talk: it involves ML 🧠\n* **Ops**: ⚙ You have built your machine learning model and your results were great in the first month. Now suddenly accuracy of your model is wearing off. Further, you tried some new models with different parameters, and one of them showed promising results, but when trying the same model again, results are not the same. You tried different features, different parameters, longer history of data, but unsure which combination gives the best result. Managing this workflow month after month sounds tedious, and model management and maintenance has become cumbersome. Your feature engineering code was working, and a recent change in code, break your model in production and you cannot run inference jobs for the rest of the day. If these problems sound familiar, we got you covered, and will cover techniques of model management, model monitoring, detecting drift and automating model promotion with systematic release.\n\nVENUE:\nThe university's brand new Q building in Honeysuckle!\n\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/35LwcLhKV1nvoFAh7\n\nIMPORTANT this is NOT the NewSpace building where we met last year.\n\nWe will meet in the Level 2 Seminar Space. You'll need to enter through the main doors on Worth Place and will be directed to the elevators to join the meetup.\n\nPARKING: The closest parking is Wright Lane Carpark.\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/rj6Yg8EkpjYzUmbi7\n\nAfter 5pm it is free and is a 400m - 5 minute walk.\n\n##-------------------------------------------------------------------##\n\nTIME: 5.30pm - 7.30pm\n\nFOOD: 🍕 + 🥤\n\n* Wood fired pizza, sponsored by Newy Tech People\n* Please advise dietary requirements in RSVP\n* Soft drinks\n\nSCHEDULE:\n\n* 5:30pm: Networking + Food + Drinks\n(Don't stress if you are held up in traffic)\n* 6:15pm: Presentation\n* 7:15pm: Packing up + Bonus questions\n* 7:30pm: Close",
