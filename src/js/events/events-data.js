We should stop fraud.\nJoin Mark as he talks about that time that he and his team of fintech-startup-wannabes tried to build a real time fraud prevention engine with Kafka Streams, Cassandra and some ML.\nDid they succeed? Was any fraud actually prevented? Just what is a Kafka Stream and where can I get one?\nTune in to find out.\n\n**About the Speaker**:\nMark has been writing code for around 20 years. He currently works as a Principal Consultant at Equal Experts helping scale-up companies scale up, and helping traditional enterprises with their digital transformations.

      "description": "This month, we have Newcastle local **Klee Thomas** telling us all we need to know about JWT (JSON Web Tokens).\n\nJWT have become ubiquitous and are a part of every web developers life. We use them everyday to authenticate ourselves, to authenticate our users and to authenticate services. That said how much do you know about JWT? Are they different from a JWE, JWS, JOSE? Are they encrypted or just encoded? Can you actually trust them? What are the risks we take on when using them?\n\nJoin Klee as he sheds light on the internals of JWT and helps you make sure that you’re building systems that are secure for your users.\n\nDate: Wednesday 28th of September\nLocation: Mudbath\nUnit 8 (Upstairs) 710 Hunter Street. Entry via the left side of the building.\nLivestream: https://livestream.mudbath.com.au/\n\nDoors open at 6pm for socialising and pizza. The talk kicks off at 7pm.\n\nOff-street parking is available directly behind the offices, entry is via the ibis hotel driveway.\n\n*Thanks to the Newy Tech People for sponsoring pizza.*",

Today, many people pickup speedrunning to continue to enjoy and relive that experience, while entertaining millions of people globally. Finishing games quickly is an intensely competitive field, and while initially a lot of focus was on optimising movement and routing, we are seeing novel data-analysis techniques applied to optimise speedruns. This talk will cover how we use aggregation, data-science, entropic analysis, and more to speed up games like The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Final Fantasy 6, and more!\nThe Speaker\nCole Cornford is the Director of Galah Cyber, an Australian Cybersecurity consultancy with a focus on Application, Cloud, and Product Security.
