This month, we've got James Diacono, organiser of NewcastleJS and Software Engineer at CrossCountry.\n\nTalk synopsis:\n*Most of our communication over the Web is secured by HTTPS. But how does HTTPS actually work? James explores the underlying cryptography of HTTPS, as well as its strengths and weaknesses. He briefly describes an experimental alternative to HTTPS, just to show that we have options.*\n\n*James Diacono is an application programmer with an amateur interest in cryptography.*\n\n**Event details:**\n\nDate: Thursday Nov 24th, 2022\nTime: 18:00-20:00\nVenue: 16 Honeysuckle Drive, Newcastle (The University of Newcastle 'Q Building') - second floor 'seminar space'\nFood: Provided, please inform us of dietary requirements when RSVPing\nDrink: Non-alcoholic provided, come and grab a few with us at the pub after if you'd like!\n\n**Getting there/parking/public transport:**\n\n* Event location is [here](https://goo.gl/maps/rCqoDx8MbjqyeHTMA) \\- please use the western door\\.
