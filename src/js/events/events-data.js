      "description": "We're back!\nIt's been about a year since we last met up in person and we're excited to get back to it. This month we’re meeting at Mudbath Digital’s (https://mudbath.com.au) Newcastle office.\n\nWe have 2 speakers lined up.\nRegulars speaker Klee Thomas will be talking about \"Allow lists suck: protecting staging in a zero trust environment with Cloudflare workers\" and Cole Conford founder of Galah Cyber will be giving a talk on hacking Zelda Ocarina of Time.\n\n\\#\\# Breaking the Ocarina \\- the intersection of app sec and gaming\nCole will be talking about an intersection of two passions that he has, AppSec and Zelda Ocarina of Time. Zelda OoT is almost 25 years old and has had extensive security research undertaken on it. Why? For speedrunning and fun. This talk will introduce you to both simple and complex bugs in OoT, how they were discovered, what their impact is, and how this is all related to helping you build secure applications.\n\nCole is the Director of Galah Cyber, a specialist Application Security consultancy. Cole has worked in the technology, finance, telco, and government sectors previously doing AppSec. He enjoys helping to grow the local Newcastle Tech scene, playing Elden Ring, and calling his French bulldog Rocco a chunky piggy doggy.\n\n\\#\\# IP Allow lists suck: Secure your staging environments in a 0 trust network with Cloudflare workers \\-\\- Klee Thomas\nProtecting your staging environment with an IP address allow list is becoming more and more unrealistic in the age of remote working. Why would you require that your employees are on a VPN so that they can do their job? Why would you require that your partner companies' employees all have to use a limited set of addresses? Implementing a solution that allows access to staging in a zero-trust environment is actually not all that hard at all. Once it’s in place you’ll be able to grant and revoke access to your staging environments on a per user basis.\nIn this talk, I’ll take you through protecting your staging environment in a zero-trust world using Cloudflare Workers and Auth0.\n\nKlee is a Software Developer and organiser of the Newcastle Coders Group. He is an Agile, Clean Code and Craftsmanship advocate who loves to talk about what we can do to build better quality, maintainable software. Outside of software development fan of Martial Arts, Netflix and spending time with his wife and cats.\n\n**Location:** Mudbath Digital 8/710 Hunter Street Newcastle\n\n**Parking:** Parking spaces nearby on street and at the spotlight parking garage.\n\n**Sponsors:** Saphi Engineering\n\n**Agenda**\n\n* 5:45 - Doors open\n* 6:00 - News\n* 6:20 - Talk 1\n* 7:20 - Pizza\n* 7:49 - Talk 2\n* 8:40 - End",

      "description": "This April, hear from fellow Novocastrian, Director & Founder of Safe Gauge Luke Dawson.\n\nLuke grew up in the Hunter Valley and went to Maitland Grossmann High finishing in 2010. As a field service technician specialising in Caterpillar equipment, some of the machines Luke was responsible for maintaining were large dump trucks, bulldozers, excavators and wheel loaders. Throughout the 8 years working in the mining industry, Luke had a few ideas on completing common high-risk jobs much safer and more efficiently.\n\n[Safe Gauge ](https://safegauge.com.au/)has gone from strength to strength over the past few years, securing investment and scaling rapidly.\n\nJoin us on April 7th from 6:30 pm - 8:30 pm at The Stag & Hunter Hotel. Feel free to grab a drink at the bar and come on up; dinner will be provided.\n\nPlease make sure to RSVP via the link in the comments, as seats are limited to 50\n\n#meetup #networking #engineering #startup #IoT",
