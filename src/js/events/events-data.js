      "title": "data.APR <- Analysing wind data: here be dragons!",
      "description": "In this talk we will try to answer a seemingly simple question: how often does the wind speed exceed a given threshold at a specific location.\n\nThis will lead us down the rabbit hole of searching for weather data, the minefield of interpreting wind behaviour from anemometers, structural wind engineering best practice and wind tunnels, distinct weather events and extreme value statistics.\n\nAlex Diamond is a mechanical come software/data engineer with experience working in many sectors including manufacturing, construction, health, nuclear physics, computation physics, wind engineering, renewable energy and retail. Much of this talk will be driven from his time working as a Wind Engineer (think bridges, not wind turbines) at Arup. He now works across backend, cloud based applications and data driven services. He also has a kind of unhealthy obsession with programming language design and implementation - expect to see some FP in this talk.\n\n##-------------------------------------------------------------------##\n\nVENUE:\n\nNEW LOCATION!\n\nThe university's brand new Q building in Honeysuckle!\n\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/35LwcLhKV1nvoFAh7\n\nIMPORTANT this is NOT the NewSpace building where we met last year.\n\nWe will meet in the Level 2 Seminar Space.

      "description": "IoT Pioneers in May, hear from Telstra's Domain Lead for Industrial IoT Mark Atkinson as he walks us through industrial IoT as a tipping point.\n\nWith the explosion of connected devices, the value proposition is no longer about connecting and monitoring. Industrial IoT now moves to a world of analysis, building insights for timely actionable outcomes.\n\nAs an experienced innovator with a proven record of bringing new technology outcomes to market, Mark helps businesses span the gap between ‘need’ and technology. Mark is also an active participant at the IoT Alliance Australia (IOTAA) - a founding member, current Lead of the Energy/Mining Work Stream and a member of the awards judging panel. Within Telstra Mark focuses on Industrial IoT - the capability to monitor behaviour at scale, provide analysis and draw insights for quick action.\n\nJoin us on May 5th from 6:30 pm - 8:30 pm at The Stag & Hunter Hotel. Feel free to grab a drink at the bar and come on up; dinner will be provided.\n\nPlease make sure to RSVP\n\n#meetup #networking #engineering #startup #IoT",
