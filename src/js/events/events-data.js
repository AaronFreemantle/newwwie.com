      "title": "Klee Thomas - Tokens, tokens everywhere: a deep dive into JWT",
      "description": "This month, we have Newcastle local **Klee Thomas** telling us all we need to know about JWT (JSON Web Tokens).\n\nJWT have become ubiquitous and are a part of every web developers life. We use them everyday to authenticate ourselves, to authenticate our users and to authenticate services. That said how much do you know about JWT? Are they different from a JWE, JWS, JOSE? Are they encrypted or just encoded? Can you actually trust them? What are the risks we take on when using them?\n\nJoin Klee as he sheds light on the internals of JWT and helps you make sure that you’re building systems that are secure for your users.\n\nDate: Wednesday 28th of September\nLocation: Mudbath\nUnit 8 (Upstairs) 710 Hunter Street. Entry via the left side of the building.\nLivestream: https://livestream.mudbath.com.au/\n\nDoors open at 6pm for socialising and pizza. The talk kicks off at 7pm.\n\nOff-street parking is available directly behind the offices, entry is via the ibis hotel driveway.\n\n*Thanks to the Newy Tech People for sponsoring pizza.*",

      "title": "October: Do you trust your compiler? + What is a text file? & why should I care?",
      "description": "In October we have two great speakers on two interesting topics. We'll have Vijay Purush speaking about the Ken Thompson Hack and Tony Brown talking about the history of text encoding.\n\nWe'll be at the Mudbath office this time around. There is on street parking available and the closest public transport is the Newcastle Interchange.\n\n**Do you trust your compiler?**\nIn 1984, Ken Thompson, the inventor of B programming language and the co-developer of Go programming language, presented an idea to inject malicious code into the binaries through a compromised compiler whilst keeping the source of the compiler, free of any malicious code. I have taken it upon myself to determine if this is possible in an interpreted language, such as JavaScript. During the talk, I will show you that it is in-fact possible and if you think this is as serious an issue as I think it is, I urge you to be vigilant of the risk it poses and possibly find a solution.\n**About Vijay Purush**\nAs a developer, I have been predominantly spending my time in recent years on JavaScript and related frameworks. But, I stared my career several years ago on WinForms using VB.NET for a large corporation in a project that had been in development for 3 years and in production for less than a year when I joined it. Needless to say, most of my initial years was spent debugging/understanding/fixing code rather than writing code. Consequently, more than the languages/frameworks that I have learnt in my career, it is the debugging skills that I value the most.\n\n**What is a text file? ... what are character encodings? ... and why should I care?**\nHow do machines that fundamentally work with numbers, work with text?\nWe take a look at how text is represented in computing, how things got this way, and the sliding doors moments where things could have taken a different turn.\n**About Tony Brown**\nTony Brown is a technical architect with nib Health Funds.\nHe has been interested in computers for quite some time now, starting out on a 8-kilobyte machine plugged into the family TV set.\nHe has an interest in old computing machinery and considers California's Computer History Museum to be the *real* happiest place on earth.",

Today, many people pickup speedrunning to continue to enjoy and relive that experience, while entertaining millions of people globally. Finishing games quickly is an intensely competitive field, and while initially a lot of focus was on optimising movement and routing, we are seeing novel data-analysis techniques applied to optimise speedruns. This talk will cover how we use aggregation, data-science, entropic analysis, and more to speed up games like The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Final Fantasy 6, and more!\nThe Speaker\nCole Cornford is the Director of Galah Cyber, an Australian Cybersecurity consultancy with a focus on Application, Cloud, and Product Security.
