      "description": "This April, hear from fellow Novocastrian, Director & Founder of Safe Gauge Luke Dawson.\n\nLuke grew up in the Hunter Valley and went to Maitland Grossmann High finishing in 2010. As a field service technician specialising in Caterpillar equipment, some of the machines Luke was responsible for maintaining were large dump trucks, bulldozers, excavators and wheel loaders. Throughout the 8 years working in the mining industry, Luke had a few ideas on completing common high-risk jobs much safer and more efficiently.\n\n[Safe Gauge ](https://safegauge.com.au/)has gone from strength to strength over the past few years, securing investment and scaling rapidly.\n\nJoin us on April 7th from 6:30 pm - 8:30 pm at The Stag & Hunter Hotel. Feel free to grab a drink at the bar and come on up; dinner will be provided.\n\nPlease make sure to RSVP via the link in the comments, as seats are limited to 50\n\n#meetup #networking #engineering #startup #IoT",

      "description": "Hey everyone, Blast Furnace in April- fire up for another opportunity to show off your skills!\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nWhat you need to know about this event:\n\n1. Laid back, no pressure and collaboration is encouraged\n2. Anyone can participate! (It doesn't matter what country you're in!)\n3. Use CodinGame to run the comps\n4. Each challenge is no longer than 10min (often faster)\n5. You can program in your choice of 24 different languages\n6. Have a practice on CodinGame beforehand if you want to get a feel\n\nHow it works:\nWe use CodinGame (https://www.codingame.com/start) to run code clashes. These are time restricted (10-15min) programming problems that you can solve using 1 of 27 different programming languages including Bash, JavaScript, Python3, C, C++ Dart, Swift, Ruby and many more...\n\nSee here for full list https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/languages-versions\n\nThere are 3 types of problems we solve:\n\n* **Fastest:** You win if you come up with the correct solution in the fastest amount of time\n* **Shortest:** The person who uses the least amount of characters to solve the problem wins\n* **Reverse:** you get given the inputs and outputs and must write the code to produce the given outputs based on the given inputs.\n\nYou get points for attempting each challenge and rewarded for coming in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd. We will complete around 6 - 8 challenges over the duration of the event and the final winner is the person with the most points at the end.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nJoin us online for a few laughs and some healthy competition!",
