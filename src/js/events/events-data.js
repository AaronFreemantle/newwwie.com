Today, many people pickup speedrunning to continue to enjoy and relive that experience, while entertaining millions of people globally. Finishing games quickly is an intensely competitive field, and while initially a lot of focus was on optimising movement and routing, we are seeing novel data-analysis techniques applied to optimise speedruns. This talk will cover how we use aggregation, data-science, entropic analysis, and more to speed up games like The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Final Fantasy 6, and more!\nThe Speaker\nCole Cornford is the Director of Galah Cyber, an Australian Cybersecurity consultancy with a focus on Application, Cloud, and Product Security. Cole has worked in the security space for 8 years across a variety of industries and cybersecurity fields. Cole helps organise a few other Newcastle communities, as well as being a regular presenter at AISA, BSides, and OWASP Conferences.\nVENUE:\nNEW LOCATION!\nThe university's brand new Q building in Honeysuckle!\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/35LwcLhKV1nvoFAh7\nIMPORTANT this is NOT the NewSpace building where we met last year.\nWe will meet in the Level 2 Seminar Space.
