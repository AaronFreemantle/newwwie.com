      "description": "NewcastleJS is back for 2022!\n\nWe are kicking off again with our monthly meetup.\nStarting with a talk from James Diacono from Equimaps.\n\nJames presents a short history of the feedback loops experienced by programmers, beginning with those measured in hours and ending with the instantaneous. He laments that we seem to have lost sight of the holy grail, but then demonstrates how JavaScripters can get it back through better use of the REPL.\n\nDate: Tuesday 28th of June\nLocation: Mudbath\nUnit 8 (Upstairs) 710 Hunter Street. Entry via the left side of the building.\n\nOff-street parking is available directly behind the offices, entry is via the ibis hotel driveway.\n\nThanks to the Newy Tech People for sponsoring pizza.\n---",
